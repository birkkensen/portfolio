		<p>
			I'm currently studying the Frontend Developer program at Hyper Island in Stockholm. Now, I'm
			looking for an internship, starting in September this year. So far I've done everything from
			creating a simple web page in just HTML / CSS, to making web applications using React (like
			this website - PS. I'm now working on re-writing my portfolio using NextJS, Typescript and
			Tailwind, for practice{' '}
			<a className={s.tempoLink} href='https://github.com/birkkensen/portfolio-next-ts'>
				Link to project on Github
			</a>
			). I have also worked a lot with different APIs, Node.js and Phaser. I'm looking forward to
			learning and contributing a lot more during an internship.
			<br />
			<br />I don't know what my career goal is. All I know is that I'm 100% sure it has to do with
			some sort of programming. Right now I'm still exploring all the possibilities code has to
			offer, all the different ways I can express my creativity with it. Don't hesitate to contact
			me if you have any questions. :)
